# Makerdiary iMX RT1011 Nano Kit

## Introduction

[iMX RT1011 Nano Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/imxrt1011-nanokit) is a small, high-performing prototyping kit designed around NXP's iMX RT1011 Crossover MCU based on the Arm Cortex-M7 core, which operates at speeds up to 500 MHz to provide high CPU performance and best real-time response. It has 128 KB on-chip RAM that can be flexibly configured as TCM or general-purpose as well as numerous peripherals including high speed USB, UART, SPI, I2C, SAI, PWM, GPIO, ADC and etc to support a wide range of applications.

The design provides external 128 Mbit QSPI flash with XIP support, flexible power management, programmable LED and Button, easy-to-use form factor with USB-C and dual-row 40 pins in DIP/SMT type, including up to 33 multi-function GPIO pins (15 can be configured as ADC inputs) and Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port. Available with loose or pre-soldered headers, for even more flexibility in your projects.

It's shipped with UF2 Bootloader for easy firmware update, which means you can easily install CircuitPython firmware by just copying the .uf2-format images to the flash drive without using an external programmer.
